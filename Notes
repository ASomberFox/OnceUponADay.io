Story = Todo List:
- Create a single Vignette
    - Center it around either Kezia, Andra, or ErYang
        - Kezia:
            - Her Vignette is either meeting Andra or Clair and having an existential crisis due to her history with them.
            - Andra is an infected knight.
            - Kezia has to confront her guilt and her betrayel that lead to the death of one of the Bro Knights,
                which inturn revealed that they were infected as they disintigrated into originium dust.
            - The survivors of the former Stormbreaker KC and its attached infected community never forgot
            - Andra might be from that community and holds a bitter opinion of Kezia or a lack of one.
            - At some point Clair will approach Andra with a sponsorship offer,
                who after the closure of her buissness due tp Kezia's actions, is now a salarywoman as corperate liaison
            - Clair will confront Kezia, as they haven't spoken for years
            - Kezia will have to confront her past via Clairs reactions
    - Each Vignette should be a mostly contained moment with minimal cronological order
        - First Moment: Kezia
            - Show off Kezia and her performance as an idol knight
                - Show how she has to swallow down her pride or wishes to keep up the act
            - Show that she is unsatisfied with her position, but still not a good person

        - Second Moment: Andra
            - Young independent infected knight out to make a name for herself.
            - Andra is approached by Clair with an sponsorship offer.
                - Certain Corporations have taken to sponsoring some infected knights as they believe:
                    - They are the hot new topic with The Blood Knights victory
                    - They are an easy target to get advertisement for their oripathy medication to the desperate infected
            - Andra starts listening to her, revealing that Clair is going out on a limb to push this because
                she genuinely wants to help the infected.
                - Clair notes that the Crimson Chalice already has many sponsors and don't want to take her offer,
                    on top of their less infected forcused structure under the Pan Hard order.
                - She also notes that other smaller infected KCs like Pinus Sylvestris or independent infected knights like "Fartooth" Justyna,
                    rejected her offer, seeing her as another KGCC puppet.
                - Andra is one of few independent infected knights left that she can turn to to offer support
            - After some discussion, Andra reluctantly agrees to Clair's offer and begin working together.

        - Third Moment: Bad Paperwork
            - Clair is confronted by her boss over her "incorrect" sponsorship offer to Andra and is moving to cancel the sponsorship.
            - Clair defends her position by arguing that this might be an oppurtunity, as Andra's infected status cuz be useful in pushing the company product.
            - Clair eats at herself internally, as the corperate jargen and objectification of Andra disgusts her, but she is determined to help Andra.
                (Note that showing Clair's characteristic of being a stats nerd, and her new role as a corperate/ sponsorship scout, is both fitting and puts more weight behind her choices.)
            - Headway is made with Clair's boss, as they conceed that this sponsorship offer may not be a bad deal.
            - With this victory, Clair attempts to push further on a moral level with a focus on the company's potential image as...
            - But she is cut off by her boss who stobbornly states that this moral position is too risky for the company and he will have to reject it.
            - Before the boss can revoke the contract, he is interrupted by his secretary with an ugrent meeting. Its from the KGCC
            - The boss immidately drops what he's doing and ushers Clair out of their office.
            - Outside, Clair contenplates on her approach to win over her boss
            - After a while her boss emerges, clearly stressed, and orders his subbordenate, Malkiewicz, to executre on a proposal he hands him.
            - Immidately after the interaction with Malkiewicz, Clair attempts to contront her boss on their previous discussion.
            - Her boss, now entirely preoccupied by the other task at hand, begrudingly gives her his approval and brushes her aside.
            - Clair thanks her boss profusely and heads to make preperations for her support of Andra.

            - It is revealed that Andra's opponent is Kezia.
            - Clair is disatisfied with this, but is further angered as her superiors order her to ask Andra to throw the match at the last moment.
            - Clair informs Andra of the order, but disobey's orders and asks Andra to kick Kezia's ass.
            - Andra acknowledges this request.
            - Kezia expecting a fixed match, is confronted by an onslaught from Andra.
            - Kezia ultimatly pervails, in spite of Andra's genuine efforts and much to Clair's dismay.
            - Kezia, however, had to break decorum to avoid defeat and is reprimanded by her manager.
                - The manager still under the assumptions that the match was fixed and Kezia's recent underperformance from her "misgivings"

            - Cold greetings are exchanged and angerd jabs are thrown between the two women

                - Kezia tries to retort by calling out Clair's current job
                - But clair deflects, noting that she is in her state because of her
                - Before Kezia can reply, Clair tears into her about her deeds, her cowardice, her greed
                - Clair reveals that it took her 9 years to rebuild her life after the Bankruptcy Kezia caused, and that her
                    contract with Andra was a result of her trying to do something inside to help the infected community she had
                    bonded with previously.

                                        ==> The fan will post about this on the Kezia fan forum, however, due to his lack of evidenance and disparaging comment of Kezia, the fanbase will bury him
                                            under a deluge of hate and subtle manipulates by Kezia's sponsors to control bury this event and protect Kezia's image.
